# Sprint 0.3 Progress Report

## DarkGhost Development - September 2025

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made during Sprint 0.3 (September 17-30, 2025) for the DarkGhost project.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. CLI Wallet Refactor (Ring-size 17)

Enhanced the CLI wallet with increased privacy through a larger ring size based on RFC-001 community vote results.

**Changes Implemented:**

- Updated default ring size from 11 to 17 (16 decoys + 1 real output)
- Modified genesis parameters in [src/core/genesis.h](src/core/genesis.h)
- Updated RingCT implementation in [src/privacy/ringct.h](src/privacy/ringct.h) and [src/privacy/ringct.cpp](src/privacy/ringct.cpp)
- Updated CLI wallet transaction creation in [src/wallet/cli_wallet.cpp](src/wallet/cli_wallet.cpp)
- Added display of current ring size in wallet interface

**Benefits Achieved:**

- Enhanced transaction privacy with 63.5% community preference
- Better resistance to statistical analysis
- Alignment with community-driven development principles

### 2. --testnet Flag Implementation

Added testnet support to all DarkGhost binaries for development and testing.

**Changes Implemented:**

- Added --testnet flag support to node daemon in [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp)
- Added --testnet flag support to CLI wallet in [src/wallet/cli_wallet.cpp](src/wallet/cli_wallet.cpp)
- Implemented network mode detection and display
- Updated interfaces to show current network mode

**Benefits Achieved:**

- Enables proper testnet development and testing
- Allows for network-specific features and parameters
- Provides clear indication of current network mode

### 3. Bulletproofs+ Audit Preparation

Prepared the Bulletproofs+ implementation for the Trail-of-Bits security audit.

**Preparation Completed:**

- Created comprehensive audit preparation document [BULLETPROOFS_AUDIT_PREP.md](BULLETPROOFS_AUDIT_PREP.md)
- Added unit tests in [src/tests/bulletproofs_test.cpp](src/tests/bulletproofs_test.cpp)
- Updated build configuration in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)
- Created build and test scripts [build_and_test_bp.sh](scripts/build_and_test_bp.sh) and [build_and_test_bp.bat](scripts/build_and_test_bp.bat)

**Audit Scope:**

- Bulletproofs+ range proof implementation
- Integration with RingCT transactions
- Commitment scheme security
- Randomization and blinding mechanisms

## Files Modified/Added

### Core Implementation

- [src/core/genesis.h](src/core/genesis.h) - Updated DEFAULT_RING_SIZE to 17
- [src/privacy/ringct.h](src/privacy/ringct.h) - Updated RingCT class to use new default
- [src/privacy/ringct.cpp](src/privacy/ringct.cpp) - Updated RingCT implementation
- [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp) - Added --testnet flag support to node daemon
- [src/wallet/cli_wallet.cpp](src/wallet/cli_wallet.cpp) - Added --testnet flag support and updated ring size

- [scripts/build_and_test_bp.bat](scripts/build_and_test_bp.bat) - Windows build script

## Testing Status

All implemented changes have been tested and verified:

### CLI Wallet Refactor

- ✅ CLI wallet compiles successfully with new ring size
- ✅ CLI wallet correctly displays ring size as 17
- ✅ Transaction creation uses 16 decoys per real output
- ✅ Wallet functionality remains intact

### --testnet Flag Implementation

- ✅ Node daemon compiles with --testnet flag support
- ✅ CLI wallet compiles with --testnet flag support
- ✅ Network mode is correctly displayed in both applications
- ✅ Flag is properly parsed and handled

### Bulletproofs+ Audit Preparation

- ✅ Audit preparation document completed
- ✅ Unit tests created and verified
- ✅ Build configuration updated
- ✅ Test scripts created for multiple platforms

## Command Line Usage

### Node Daemon

```bash
# Mainnet mode (default)
./darkghostd

# Testnet mode
./darkghostd --testnet
```

### CLI Wallet

```bash
# Mainnet mode (default)
./darkghost-wallet-cli

# Testnet mode
./darkghost-wallet-cli --testnet
```

## Technical Details

### Ring Size Enhancement

The ring size has been increased from 11 (10 decoys + 1 real) to 17 (16 decoys + 1 real):

**Impact Analysis:**

- **Privacy**: Significantly improved resistance to statistical analysis
- **Transaction Size**: Increased by approximately 50%
- **Verification Time**: Slightly increased due to larger ring signatures
- **Network Bandwidth**: Increased requirements for transaction propagation

### Testnet Implementation

The --testnet flag enables a separate network mode:

**Features:**

- Different network parameters (ports, magic bytes, etc.)
- Testnet-specific display in interfaces
- Foundation for future testnet-only functionality
- Clear separation between mainnet and testnet operations

### Bulletproofs+ Audit Preparation

Comprehensive preparation for security audit:

**Components:**

- Range proof generation and verification
- Integration with RingCT transactions
- Commitment scheme implementation
- Aggregation of multiple proofs

## Remaining Tasks for Sprint 0.3

- Deterministic build matrix creation
- Whitepaper v1.0 completion in LaTeX
- Halving schedule documentation and graphics

## Next Steps

1. Implement deterministic build system using Guix
2. Complete academic whitepaper in LaTeX format
3. Create halving schedule documentation with visualizations
4. Prepare for public testnet launch (Milestone 1)

## Team Performance

- @dev-wallet: CLI wallet refactor ✅
- @dev-core: --testnet flag implementation ✅
- @security: Bulletproofs+ audit preparation ✅

## Issues and Resolutions

No major issues encountered during implementation.

## Conclusion

Sprint 0.3 is progressing well with all core tasks completed ahead of schedule. The CLI wallet now uses the enhanced privacy features voted on by the community, all binaries support testnet mode, and the Bulletproofs+ implementation is prepared for audit. These changes strengthen DarkGhost's privacy features and development infrastructure, setting a solid foundation for the upcoming public testnet launch.
