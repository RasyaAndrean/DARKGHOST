# Sprint 0.2 Summary

## DarkGhost Development - September 2025

This document summarizes the work completed during Sprint 0.2 (September 3-16, 2025) for the DarkGhost project.

## Goals

- Tweak RandomX v2 for enhanced ASIC resistance
- Set up 3-node devnet with Docker-compose
- Implement Discord faucet bot with slash commands
- Create devnet explorer
- Prepare RFC-001 ring-size vote

## Completed Tasks

### 1. RandomX v2 Tweaks

Enhanced the RandomX v2 implementation with DarkGhost-specific parameters:

- Increased scratchpad size to 2MB (from 1MB)
- Increased dataset size to 256MB (from 208MB)
- Increased program size to 512 (from 256)
- Increased program iterations to 1024 (from 512)
- Added DarkGhost-specific methods: initializeScratchpad(), executeProgram(), getHashRateAdjustment()

Documentation: [RANDOMX_V2_TWEAKS.md](RANDOMX_V2_TWEAKS.md)

### 2. 3-Node Devnet Setup

Created a complete Docker Compose setup for a 3-node devnet:

- Node 1: Bootstrap node with configuration file
- Node 2: Peer node with configuration file
- Node 3: Peer node with configuration file
- Faucet service integrated
- Custom network with static IP addresses

Files created:

- [docker-compose.devnet.yml](../docker-compose.devnet.yml)
- [darkghost.conf.node1](../darkghost.conf.node1)
- [darkghost.conf.node2](../darkghost.conf.node2)
- [darkghost.conf.node3](../darkghost.conf.node3)
- [scripts/devnet_up.sh](../scripts/devnet_up.sh)
- [scripts/devnet_down.sh](../scripts/devnet_down.sh)
- [scripts/devnet_up.bat](../scripts/devnet_up.bat)
- [scripts/devnet_down.bat](../scripts/devnet_down.bat)

### 3. Discord Faucet Bot

Implemented a Discord bot with both prefix and slash command support:

- `/faucet <address>` command to claim testnet tokens
- `/balance` command to check faucet balance
- `/help` command for user guidance
- 24-hour cooldown per user
- Address validation

File: [scripts/faucet_bot.py](../scripts/faucet_bot.py)

### 4. Devnet Explorer

Created a basic blockchain explorer for the devnet:

- Web interface using Node.js and Express
- Block, transaction, and address browsing
- Network statistics API
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- MongoDB integration (planned)

Files created:

- [explorer/](../explorer/) directory with complete structure
- [docs/DEVNET_EXPLORER.md](DEVNET_EXPLORER.md)
- [scripts/start_explorer.sh](../scripts/start_explorer.sh)
- [scripts/start_explorer.bat](../scripts/start_explorer.bat)

### 5. RFC-001 Ring-Size Vote Preparation

Prepared for the community vote on ring size:

- Created detailed RFC document
- Created GitHub issue template
- Created specific issue for RFC-001
- Defined voting process and timeline

Files created:

- [docs/RFC-001_RING_SIZE_VOTE.md](RFC-001_RING_SIZE_VOTE.md)
- [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc_template.md](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc_template.md)
- [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc-001-ring-size-vote.md](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc-001-ring-size-vote.md)

## Testing

All components have been tested and verified:

- Docker Compose devnet starts and runs correctly
- Nodes communicate with each other
- Faucet bot responds to commands
- Explorer displays sample data
- Configuration files are properly formatted

## Next Steps (Sprint 0.3)

- CLI wallet refactoring with Ring-size 11 default
- Bulletproofs+ audit
- Whitepaper v1.0 in LaTeX
- Finalize build matrix for Windows/macOS/Ubuntu
- Halving schedule documentation

## Issues and Resolutions

No major issues encountered during this sprint. All tasks were completed on time and according to specifications.

## Team Performance

All team members completed their assigned tasks:

- @dev-core: RandomX v2 tweaks
- @dev-ops: Devnet 3-node setup
- @dev-bot: Faucet bot implementation
- @dev-web: Devnet explorer
- @community: RFC-001 preparation

## Deliverables

- `v0.2.0-devnet` release ready
- Complete devnet infrastructure
- Community voting mechanism established
- Documentation for all components

## Conclusion

Sprint 0.2 was successfully completed with all deliverables met. The devnet is fully functional and ready for testing. The community can now participate in the RFC-001 vote to determine the default ring size for DarkGhost.
