# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is DarkGhost?

DarkGhost (DG) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that combines Bitcoin's UTXO model with Monero's privacy features. It offers the transparency and efficiency of Bitcoin's transaction structure with the privacy protections of Monero.

### How is DarkGhost different from Bitcoin?

While DarkGhost uses Bitcoin's UTXO transaction model, it adds privacy features like RingCT, Stealth Addresses, and Bulletproofs from Monero. It also has a different supply schedule (100 million vs 21 million) and faster block times (2 minutes vs 10 minutes).

### How is DarkGhost different from Monero?

DarkGhost uses Bitcoin's UTXO model instead of Monero's account-based model with ring signatures. This provides different trade-offs in terms of scalability and compatibility with existing Bitcoin tools.

### What is the total supply of DarkGhost?

DarkGhost has a fixed supply of 100 million DG tokens with no tail emission, unlike Monero which has unlimited supply through tail emission.

### What is the block time?

DarkGhost has a target block time of 2 minutes, which is 5 times faster than Bitcoin's 10 minutes.

## Technical Questions

### What consensus algorithm does DarkGhost use?

DarkGhost uses RandomX v2, a CPU-friendly and ASIC-resistant mining algorithm forked from Monero's RandomX.

### What privacy features does DarkGhost implement?

DarkGhost implements three core privacy features:

1. **RingCT**: Mixes real transactions with decoy outputs
2. **Stealth Addresses**: One-time addresses for each transaction
3. **Bulletproofs**: Efficient range proofs that reduce transaction size

### What is the ring size?

DarkGhost uses a default ring size of 11, which means each transaction mixes 1 real output with 10 decoy outputs.

### Can I mine DarkGhost?

Yes, DarkGhost is mineable using CPU miners that support the RandomX algorithm. XMRig is the recommended mining software.

### What wallets are available?

DarkGhost offers multiple wallet options:

1. **CLI Wallet**: Command-line interface for advanced users
2. **GUI Wallet**: Graphical interface for desktop users
3. **Mobile Wallet**: Android and iOS applications
4. **Hardware Wallet**: Planned support for Ledger and Trezor

## Mining Questions

### What hardware can I use to mine DarkGhost?

DarkGhost is designed to be CPU-mined, making it accessible to a wide range of hardware including modern Intel and AMD processors.

### What is the mining algorithm?

DarkGhost uses RandomX v2, which is optimized for general-purpose CPUs and resistant to ASIC mining.

### How often does the difficulty adjust?

The difficulty adjusts every 10 blocks to maintain the target 2-minute block time.

### What is the initial block reward?

The initial block reward is 50 DG per block, which halves every 4 years (similar to Bitcoin).

### Are there mining pools available?

Yes, there are several mining pools available. The official pool is at pool.darkghost.network.

## Wallet Questions

### How do I secure my DarkGhost wallet?

1. **Backup your seed phrase**: Write down and store your 12 or 24-word recovery phrase securely
2. **Use strong passwords**: Create complex, unique passwords for wallet encryption
3. **Enable encryption**: Always encrypt your wallet files
4. **Keep software updated**: Use the latest wallet version
5. **Use cold storage**: For large amounts, consider hardware wallets or paper wallets

### What is a seed phrase?

A seed phrase is a 12 or 24-word backup that can restore your wallet and all its funds. It's the ultimate backup method and should be stored securely offline.

### How do stealth addresses work?

Stealth addresses are one-time addresses generated for each transaction. They prevent linking transactions to your public address, enhancing privacy.

### Can I use my existing Monero wallet with DarkGhost?

No, DarkGhost requires specific wallet software due to its different transaction structure and privacy implementation.

### What is the difference between view key and spend key?

- **View Key**: Allows you to scan the blockchain to see incoming transactions
- **Spend Key**: Required to spend your DarkGhost funds

## Network Questions

### How many confirmations are needed?

For regular transactions, 10 confirmations are generally considered secure. For larger amounts, you may want to wait for more confirmations.

### Is DarkGhost decentralized?

Yes, DarkGhost is a fully decentralized network with no central authority. It's maintained by a distributed network of nodes and miners.

### How large are DarkGhost transactions?

Transactions are significantly smaller than Monero transactions due to Bulletproofs, typically around 1-2 KB depending on the number of inputs.

### What is the block size limit?

DarkGhost uses dynamic block sizing, allowing blocks to grow based on network demand while maintaining reasonable limits to prevent spam.

## Development Questions

### Is DarkGhost open source?

Yes, DarkGhost is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

### How can I contribute to DarkGhost?

### What programming language is DarkGhost written in?

DarkGhost is primarily written in C++ with some components in other languages as needed.

## Economic Questions

### Will the supply ever change?

No, DarkGhost has a fixed supply of 100 million DG tokens. There is no inflation or tail emission.

### How does halving work?

The block reward halves approximately every 4 years (1,051,200 blocks), similar to Bitcoin's schedule.

### Is DarkGhost deflationary?

With a fixed supply and growing adoption, DarkGhost can be considered deflationary in nature, similar to Bitcoin.

### What gives DarkGhost value?

DarkGhost derives value from:

1. **Scarcity**: Fixed supply creates scarcity
2. **Utility**: Privacy features provide practical utility
3. **Network effects**: Growing user base and ecosystem
4. **Technology**: Innovative hybrid approach to blockchain design

## Legal and Compliance

### Is DarkGhost legal?

DarkGhost is legal in most jurisdictions, but cryptocurrency regulations vary by country. Users should verify their local laws.

### Can exchanges list DarkGhost?

Exchanges make their own decisions about which cryptocurrencies to list based on their policies and risk assessments.

## Troubleshooting

### My wallet won't sync

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify your node is running and accessible

### I sent coins to the wrong address

Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. Always double-check recipient addresses before sending.

### My transaction is stuck

1. Check if the transaction was properly broadcast
2. Verify you paid sufficient fees
3. Wait for network congestion to decrease
4. Contact the recipient to confirm they can see the transaction

### I lost my seed phrase

If you've lost your seed phrase and don't have wallet backups, your funds are likely lost permanently. This is why backing up your seed phrase is crucial.
