## Technical Details

### Ring Size Enhancement

The ring size has been increased from 11 (10 decoys + 1 real) to 17 (16 decoys + 1 real):

**Impact Analysis:**

- **Privacy**: Significantly improved resistance to statistical analysis
- **Transaction Size**: Increased by approximately 50%
- **Verification Time**: Slightly increased due to larger ring signatures
- **Network Bandwidth**: Increased requirements for transaction propagation

### Testnet Implementation

The --testnet flag enables a separate network mode:

**Features:**

- Different network parameters (ports, magic bytes, etc.)
- Testnet-specific display in interfaces
- Foundation for future testnet-only functionality
- Clear separation between mainnet and testnet operations

### Bulletproofs+ Audit Preparation

Comprehensive preparation for security audit:

**Components:**

- Range proof generation and verification
- Integration with RingCT transactions
- Commitment scheme implementation
- Aggregation of multiple proofs

### Deterministic Build Matrix

Foundation for reproducible builds:

**Platforms:**

- Windows (x86_64)
- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Ubuntu (x86_64, armhf, aarch64)

## Remaining Tasks for v0.3.0-alpha

- Finalize whitepaper content and compile PDF
- Complete halving schedule graphics
- Conduct Bulletproofs+ audit with Trail-of-Bits
- Create GitHub release with changelog

## Next Steps (Milestone 1 - Public Testnet)

1. Genesis block ceremony preparation (October 1, 2025)
2. Public testnet launch (October 2-3, 2025)
3. Mining pool reference implementation
4. Exchange listing preparation
5. Hardware wallet integration

## Team Performance

- @dev-wallet: CLI wallet refactor ✅

- @dev-cicd: Deterministic build matrix ✅
- @research: Whitepaper foundation ✅
- @economics: Halving schedule documentation ✅

## Issues and Resolutions

No major issues encountered during implementation.

## Conclusion

Sprint 0.3 has been successfully completed with all deliverables finished ahead of schedule. The CLI wallet now uses the enhanced privacy features voted on by the community, all binaries support testnet mode, the Bulletproofs+ implementation is prepared for audit, and the deterministic build matrix is established. These changes strengthen DarkGhost's privacy features and development infrastructure, setting a solid foundation for the upcoming public testnet launch.

The v0.3.0-alpha release is ready for final preparation, with all core components implemented and tested. The team is well-positioned to move into Milestone 1 and launch the public testnet as planned.
