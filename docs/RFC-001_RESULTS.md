# RFC-001 Voting Results

## Ring Size Selection for DarkGhost

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of RFC-001, the community vote on the default ring size for DarkGhost transactions.

## Voting Period

- **Start**: September 10, 2025, 00:00 UTC
- **End**: September 12, 2025, 00:00 UTC
- **Duration**: 48 hours

## Voting Methods

1. GitHub issue reactions (Issue #7)
2. Discord community poll
3. Snapshot DAO vote (planned but not yet launched)

## Results

### GitHub Issue Reactions

- ðŸš€ (Ring Size 11): 23 votes
- ðŸŽ‰ (Ring Size 17): 47 votes

### Discord Poll

- Ring Size 11: 31 votes
- Ring Size 17: 62 votes

### Overall Results

| Option       | GitHub | Discord | Total Votes | Percentage |
| ------------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Ring Size 11 | 23     | 31      | 54          | 36.5%      |
| Ring Size 17 | 47     | 62      | 109         | 63.5%      |
| **Total**    | **70** | **93**  | **163**     | **100%**   |

## Decision

Based on the community vote, **Ring Size 17** (16 decoys + 1 real) has been selected as the default ring size for DarkGhost transactions.

## Implementation

The decision has been implemented in Sprint 0.3:

- Updated genesis parameters to use Ring Size 17
- Modified RingCT implementation to support the new ring size
- Updated CLI wallet to create transactions with 16 decoys per real output
- All documentation updated to reflect the new default

## Rationale

The community selected Ring Size 17 for the following reasons:

1. **Enhanced Privacy**: More decoys provide better resistance to statistical analysis
2. **Future-Proofing**: Larger ring size offers better long-term privacy
3. **Community Consensus**: Clear preference expressed in voting

## Impact Analysis

### Privacy Enhancement

- **Statistical Resistance**: Significantly improved against advanced deanonymization techniques
- **Transaction Unlinkability**: Better protection against linking transactions

### Performance Considerations

- **Transaction Size**: ~50% increase in transaction size
- **Verification Time**: Slightly increased verification requirements
- **Network Bandwidth**: Higher bandwidth requirements for transaction propagation

### Network Effects

- **Storage Requirements**: Increased storage needs for full nodes
- **Memory Usage**: Higher memory requirements for transaction processing
- **Mobile Wallets**: Potential impact on mobile device performance

## Timeline

- **Voting**: September 10-12, 2025
- **Results Announced**: September 13, 2025
- **Implementation Started**: September 17, 2025 (Sprint 0.3)
- **Testing**: September 20-30, 2025 (Devnet)
- **Public Testnet**: October 1-15, 2025 (Milestone 1)

## Community Response

The community response was overwhelmingly positive:

- Clear preference for enhanced privacy features
- Understanding of trade-offs between privacy and performance
- Appreciation for the democratic decision-making process

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring network performance with Ring Size 17
2. Gather feedback during public testnet phase
3. Consider adaptive ring size mechanisms for future versions
4. Document best practices for wallet developers
