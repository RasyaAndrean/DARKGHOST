# DarkGhost Release Process

This document describes the release process for DarkGhost, including versioning, testing, and distribution procedures.

## Overview

DarkGhost follows a structured release process to ensure quality, security, and consistency. Releases are versioned according to semantic versioning and undergo thorough testing before distribution.

## Versioning Scheme

### Semantic Versioning

DarkGhost uses semantic versioning (SemVer): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to the protocol or API
- **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes that are backward compatible

### Version Examples

- `0.1.0-alpha`: Initial alpha release
- `0.9.0-testnet`: Testnet release
- `1.0.0`: Mainnet launch
- `1.1.0`: New feature release
- `1.1.1`: Bug fix release

### Pre-release Identifiers

- **alpha**: Early development release
- **beta**: Feature-complete but not fully tested
- **rc**: Release candidate, final testing phase

## Release Types

### Alpha Releases

- **Purpose**: Early testing and development feedback
- **Frequency**: As needed during development
- **Stability**: Unstable, may contain breaking changes
- **Target Audience**: Developers and early adopters

### Beta Releases

- **Purpose**: Feature testing and user feedback
- **Frequency**: Monthly or as features are completed
- **Stability**: Moderately stable, feature-complete
- **Target Audience**: Testers and advanced users

### Release Candidates

- **Purpose**: Final testing before stable release
- **Frequency**: Weekly during release preparation
- **Stability**: Stable, no known critical issues
- **Target Audience**: All users for final testing

### Stable Releases

- **Purpose**: Production-ready software
