# DarkGhost Internationalization (i18n) Guide

## Overview

This guide provides information about internationalizing and localizing DarkGhost software and documentation to support users worldwide. Our goal is to make DarkGhost accessible to speakers of all languages while maintaining technical accuracy and cultural sensitivity.

## Language Support Strategy

### Priority Languages

1. **English** - Primary development language
2. **Chinese (Simplified)** - Large cryptocurrency market
3. **Spanish** - Widely spoken globally
4. **Russian** - Significant crypto community
5. **French** - European market
6. **German** - European market
7. **Japanese** - Tech-savvy market
8. **Korean** - Active crypto community
9. **Portuguese** - Growing markets in Brazil and Portugal
10. **Italian** - European adoption

### Community-Driven Translation

We believe in community-driven localization efforts where native speakers contribute translations and cultural adaptations.

## Technical Implementation

### String Management

#### Resource Files

All user-facing strings should be stored in resource files rather than hardcoded in source code.

```json
{
  "wallet": {
    "title": "DarkGhost Wallet",
    "balance": "Balance",
    "send": "Send",
    "receive": "Receive"
  },
  "errors": {
    "insufficient_funds": "Insufficient funds",
    "invalid_address": "Invalid address"
  }
}
```

#### String Keys

- Use descriptive, hierarchical keys
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Avoid concatenating strings in code

#### Placeholders

Use placeholders for dynamic content:

```json
{
  "transaction_sent": "Transaction of {amount} DG sent to {address}"
}
```

### Code Implementation

#### GUI Applications

```cpp
// Example using Qt translation system
QString translatedText = tr("Send Transaction");
```

#### CLI Applications

```cpp
// Example using gettext
const char* translatedText = gettext("Transaction successful");
```

#### Web Applications

```javascript
// Example using i18next
const translatedText = i18next.t('wallet.balance');
```

### Date and Time Localization

#### Formatting

- Use locale-appropriate date formats
- Support 12-hour and 24-hour time formats
- Handle timezone conversions properly

#### Examples

```json
{
  "date_formats": {
    "short": "MM/dd/yyyy",
    "long": "MMMM d, yyyy",
    "time": "hh:mm a"
  }
}
```

### Number and Currency Formatting

#### Decimal Separators

- Use locale-appropriate decimal separators (.,)
- Handle thousands separators correctly

#### Currency Display

- Show amounts in DG (DarkGhost coins)
- Support localized number formatting

#### Examples

```json
{
  "number_format": {
    "decimal_separator": ".",
    "thousands_separator": ",",
    "decimal_places": 8
  }
}
```

## Cultural Considerations

### Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages

- Support RTL text direction for languages like Arabic and Hebrew
- Test UI layouts with RTL text
- Ensure proper text alignment

### Color Considerations

- Be aware of cultural meanings of colors
- Avoid colors with negative connotations in target cultures
- Test color contrast for accessibility

### Iconography

- Use universally understood icons
- Adapt icons for cultural contexts when necessary
- Provide text labels for all icons

### Legal and Regulatory

- Adapt terms of service for local regulations
- Consider local tax implications
- Comply with data protection laws (GDPR, etc.)

  "locale": "es_ES",
  "direction": "ltr",
  "strings": {
    "common": {
      "ok": "Aceptar",
      "cancel": "Cancelar",
      "save": "Guardar"
    },
    "wallet": {

      "balance": "Saldo",
      "send": "Enviar",
      "receive": "Recibir"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Metadata

Include metadata for proper handling:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "language_code": "es",
    "country_code": "ES",
    "text_direction": "ltr",
    "plural_forms": "nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);"
  }
}
```

### Pluralization Support

#### Plural Forms

Different languages have different pluralization rules:

```json
{
  "files_count": {
    "one": "1 archivo",
    "other": "{count} archivos"
  }
}
```

#### Implementation

Use appropriate pluralization functions:

```javascript
// Example using i18next pluralization
const message = i18next.t('files_count', { count: 5 });
```

### Gender and Formality

#### Gender-Specific Translations

Some languages require gender-specific translations:

```json
{
  "welcome_user": {
    "male": "Bienvenido, {name}",
    "female": "Bienvenida, {name}",
    "neutral": "Bienvenido/a, {name}"
  }
}
```
