# DarkGhost Project Final Reorganization Report

## Executive Summary

The DarkGhost project has been successfully reorganized to improve file organization, maintainability, and user experience. This report details the changes made, the benefits achieved, and the current state of the project structure.

## Project Overview

DarkGhost [DG] is a hybrid cryptocurrency that combines Bitcoin's UTXO model with Monero's privacy features. The project implements a fixed supply of 100 million tokens with a 2-minute block time, RandomX v2 consensus algorithm, and advanced privacy features including RingCT, Bulletproofs, and Stealth Addresses.

## Reorganization Objectives

The primary objectives of the reorganization were to:

1. Improve project organization and maintainability
2. Separate documentation from source code and scripts
3. Create a logical directory structure for easier navigation
4. Enhance discoverability of project components
5. Facilitate future development and collaboration

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Directory Structure Transformation

#### Before Reorganization

The project had a flat structure with documentation files, scripts, and source code mixed in the root directory:

```
DarkGhost/
├── src/ (source code)
├── build/ (build artifacts)
├── *.md files (20+ documentation files)
├── *.bat files (5+ batch scripts)
├── *.sh files (1 shell script)
├── Configuration files (Dockerfile, CMakeLists.txt, etc.)
└── Other project files
```

#### After Reorganization

The project now has a clean, organized structure with dedicated directories:

```
DarkGhost/
├── src/                    # Source code organized by modules
├── build/                  # Build directory with compiled binaries
├── docs/                   # Documentation files (.md)
├── scripts/                # Scripts and build tools (.bat, .sh)
├── Dockerfile              # Containerization configuration
├── CMakeLists.txt          # Root CMake build configuration
├── Makefile                # Build configuration for Linux/macOS
├── LICENSE                 # License file
├── README.md               # Project overview
└── Other configuration files
```
