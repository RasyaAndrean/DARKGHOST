### Notes:

- DG starts at 50 DG/block (vs 50 BTC/block for Bitcoin)
- DG halves every 4 years (same as Bitcoin)
- DG has fixed supply of 100M (vs 21M for Bitcoin)
- DG reaches near-zero emission faster due to higher initial supply

### Transaction Fee Dependency

As block rewards decrease, transaction fees become a larger portion of miner income:

## Network Security Implications

The decreasing block rewards over time may impact network security:

1. **Early Years (High Rewards)**: Strong mining incentives
2. **Middle Years (Moderate Rewards)**: Balanced security and inflation
3. **Later Years (Low Rewards)**: Reliance on transaction fees

## Community Governance

Future adjustments to the halving schedule would require:

1. RFC proposal and community discussion
2. On-chain voting mechanism
3. Consensus implementation
4. Network upgrade
