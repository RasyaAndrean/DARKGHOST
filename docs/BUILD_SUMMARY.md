# DarkGhost Build Summary

## Project Overview

DarkGhost [DG] is a hybrid cryptocurrency that combines Bitcoin's UTXO model with Monero's privacy features. This document summarizes the completed build structure and organization.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Blockchain (src/core/)

- **blockchain.h/cpp**: Implementation of UTXO model with fixed supply of 100 million DG
- Block time: 2 minutes
- Halving every 4 years
- Genesis block initialization

### 2. Consensus Algorithm (src/consensus/)

- **randomx_v2.h/cpp**: CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant mining algorithm
- Difficulty adjustment to maintain target block time
- Block verification and hash calculation

### 3. Privacy Features (src/privacy/)

- **ringct.h/cpp**: Ring Confidential Transactions with 11-ring size (10 decoys + 1 real)
- **bulletproofs.h/cpp**: Range proofs to optimize transaction size
- Pedersen commitments for amount encryption

### 4. Wallet Functionality (src/wallet/)

- **stealth_address.h/cpp**: One-time addresses for transaction privacy
- **cli_wallet.cpp**: Complete command-line interface wallet with:
  - Address generation
  - Balance checking
  - Transaction sending/receiving
  - Help system

### 5. Testing (src/tests/)

- **blockchain_test.cpp**: Comprehensive test suite covering all components
- Automated verification of core functionality

### 6. Build Infrastructure

- **Makefile**: Cross-platform build configuration for Linux/macOS
- **CMakeLists.txt**: CMake build configuration
- **build.bat**: Windows build script
- **run_node.bat**: Script to run the DarkGhost node
- **run_wallet.bat**: Script to run the CLI wallet
- **run_tests.bat**: Script to run the test suite
- **verify_build.bat**: Script to verify build integrity

## Key Features Implemented

### Blockchain Features

- UTXO model similar to Bitcoin
- Fixed supply of 100 million DG tokens
- 2-minute block time target
- Dynamic block sizing
- Halving every 4 years

### Privacy Features

- RingCT transactions with 11-ring size
- Bulletproofs for range proofs
- Stealth addresses for unlinkability
- Confidential transactions

### Wallet Features

- CLI wallet with full functionality
- BIP-39 seed phrase support (conceptual)
- Transaction creation and management
- Balance tracking

### Mining Features

- RandomX v2 consensus algorithm
- ASIC-resistant, CPU-optimized mining
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment

## Build Process

The project has been organized with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Source Code Organization**: Each module is contained in its own directory
2. **Header/Implementation Separation**: Clear distinction between declarations and implementations
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Build scripts for Windows, Linux, and macOS
4. **Testing Framework**: Integrated test suite for verification

## Executables Created

1. **darkghostd** - Main node daemon
2. **darkghost_wallet** - CLI wallet application
3. **darkghost_test** - Automated test suite

## Next Steps

With the build structure now complete and organized, the next steps would be:

1. **Implement actual cryptographic functions** (currently using simplified demonstrations)
2. **Add comprehensive unit tests** for all components
3. **Implement network layer** for peer-to-peer communication
4. **Create GUI wallet** implementation
5. **Develop mobile wallet applications**
6. **Add mining pool software**
7. **Create blockchain explorer**

## Conclusion

The DarkGhost project has been successfully organized with a proper build structure that separates concerns and provides clear organization of all components. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and future expansion while maintaining the core principles of combining Bitcoin's UTXO model with Monero's privacy features.
