## RFC-001: Ring Size Selection for DarkGhost

### Overview

This RFC proposes a community vote to determine the default ring size for DarkGhost transactions. Vote by reacting to this issue:

- ðŸš€ for Ring Size 11 (5 decoys + 1 real)
- ðŸŽ‰ for Ring Size 17 (11 decoys + 1 real)

### Background

Ring signatures are a core privacy feature in DarkGhost that obscure the true sender of a transaction by mixing their signature with others. The ring size determines how many decoys are included in each signature.
