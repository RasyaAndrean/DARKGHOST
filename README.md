## Key Features

### Blockchain Architecture

- **UTXO Model**: Bitcoin-style unspent transaction output model for efficient transaction processing
- **Fixed Supply**: Limited to 100 million DG tokens with no inflation
- **Fast Blocks**: 2-minute block time for rapid transaction confirmation
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Blocks automatically adjust size based on network demand

### Consensus Mechanism

- **RandomX v2**: CPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant mining algorithm
- **Proof of Work**: Secure and decentralized consensus mechanism
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Maintains consistent 2-minute block intervals

### Privacy Features

- **RingCT**: Ring Confidential Transactions with 11-ring size (10 decoys + 1 real)
- **Bulletproofs**: Efficient range proofs that reduce transaction size by 80%
- **Stealth Addresses**: One-time addresses for each transaction to prevent linking
- **Unlinkability**: No connection between sender and recipient addresses
